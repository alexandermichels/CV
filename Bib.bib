	abstract = {{In this tutorial, we will first start with the basics of CyberGISJupyter and CyberGIS-Compute, then introduce the Python SDK for CyberGIS-Compute with a simple Hello World example. Then, we will take multiple real-world geospatial applications use-cases like spatial accessibility and wildfire evacuation simulation using agent based modeling. We will also provide pointers on how to contribute applications to the CyberGIS-Compute framework.}}
